# A/B Testing
Here are some functions that are useful for examining an ab test for both normally distributed and non normally distributed data between two groups. 

### Installation
Works with standard Anaconda distribution or python3. Required packages are at
the top of the ab_test_analysis.py file. 

### Motivation
Help speed up the process of processing test results in an A/B testing environment. 

### File Descriptions
ab_test_analysis.py is a python file that has a list of functions that can be called once imported to analyze data from a test and provide insights from 
distributional properties to statistical significance. 

### Results
N/A
